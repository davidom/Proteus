To use these routines, the UG (general purpose routines), UG3 (general purpose
3D routines), and DFTR3 (3D distribution function and transformation vector
library) must be linked using the compiler flags "-Lsimcenter_sys_dir -lug3
-lug". The directory simcenter_sys_dir is the SimCenter system directory
that is stored in the environment variable $SIMCENTER_SYS_DIR. C or C++ source
code that contains a call to one of the UG3 routines must have the following
include statement, #include "simcenter_sys_dir/src/ug3/UG3_LIB.h". This
statement includes the UG library include file,
simcenter_sys_dir/src/ug/UG_LIB.h. See the UG library documentation file,
simcenter_sys_dir/src/ug/UG_LIB.txt, for further information.
