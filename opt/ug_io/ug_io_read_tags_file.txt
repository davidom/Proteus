DESCRIPTION
-----------

Read surface grid BC and normal spacing data from a standard UG tags data file.

INPUT ARGUMENTS
---------------

Tags_Data_File_Name      : Tags data file name.

UG_IO_Param_Struct_Ptr   : UG_IO parameter structure.

Message_Flag             : Output message flag.
                           If Message_Flag =  0 then no information messages
                           are written.
                           If Message_Flag >= 1 then information messages are
                           written to standard output.

Number_of_Surf_Quads     : Number of boundary surface quad faces.

Number_of_Surf_Trias     : Number of boundary surface tria faces.

Surf_Grid_BC_Flag        : Surface face grid boundary condition flag.
                           If Surf_Grid_BC_Flag = NULL then this array is not
                           used. This array uses "FORTRAN" style indexing with
                           an index which ranges from one to
                           Number_of_Surf_Quads+Number_of_Surf_Trias. The first
                           one to Number_of_Surf_Trias entries correspond to
                           boundary surface tria faces. The next
                           Number_of_Surf_Trias+1 to
                           Number_of_Surf_Trias+Number_of_Surf_Quads entries
                           correspond to boundary surface quad faces. Array
                           location zero is not used. This array is used
                           primarily for grid generation.

Surf_ID_Flag             : Surface face ID flag.
                           This array uses "FORTRAN" style indexing with an
                           index which ranges from one to Number_of_Surf_Trias+
                           Number_of_Surf_Quads. The first one to
                           Number_of_Surf_Trias entries correspond to boundary
                           surface tria faces. The next Number_of_Surf_Trias+1
                           to Number_of_Surf_Trias+Number_of_Surf_Quads entries
                           correspond to boundary surface quad faces. Array
                           location zero is not used. This array allows surface
                           faces to be grouped. Typically surface faces with
                           the same ID flag represent a complete surface or
                           enclosed surface.

Surf_Reconnection_Flag   : Surface face reconnection flag.
                           If Surf_Reconnection_Flag = NULL then this array is
                           not used. This array uses "FORTRAN" style indexing
                           with a primary index which ranges from one to
                           Number_of_Surf_Trias+Number_of_Surf_Quads. The
                           first one to Number_of_Surf_Trias entries correspond
                           to boundary surface tria faces. The next
                           Number_of_Surf_Trias+1 to Number_of_Surf_Trias+
                           Number_of_Surf_Quads entries correspond to boundary
                           surface quad faces. Array location zero is not used.
                           This array is used primarily for grid generation.

Surf_Quad_Connectivity   : Surface grid quad face connectivity.
                           This array uses "FORTRAN" style indexing with an
                           index which ranges from one to Number_of_Surf_Quads.
                           Array location zero is not used. The secondary index
                           uses "C" style indexing with an index which ranges
                           from zero to three corresponding to the four nodes
                           of a particular quad face. The node index value
                           stored in this array can vary from one to
                           Number_of_Nodes.

Surf_Tria_Connectivity   : Surface grid tria face connectivity.
                           This array uses "FORTRAN" style indexing with an
                           index which ranges from one to Number_of_Surf_Trias.
                           Array location zero is not used. The secondary index
                           uses "C" style indexing with an index which ranges
                           from zero to two corresponding to the three nodes of
                           a particular tria face. The node index value stored
                           in this array can vary from one to Number_of_Nodes.

Initial_Normal_Spacing   : Grid node initial normal spacing for boundary-layer
                           type grids.
                           If Initial_Normal_Spacing = NULL then this array is
                           not used. This array uses "FORTRAN" style indexing
                           with an index which ranges from one to
                           Number_of_Nodes. Array location zero is not used.
                           This array is used primarily for grid generation.

BL_Thickness             : Thickness of boundary-layer region for boundary-layer
                           type grids.
                           If BL_Thickness = NULL then this array is
                           not used. This array uses "FORTRAN" style indexing
                           with an index which ranges from one to
                           Number_of_Nodes. Array location zero is not used.

                           data file name is not a standard UG tags data file.
                           Nothing is done in this case.
                           The return value will be between -600 and -699.
