INPUT ARGUMENTS
---------------

Grid_File_Name           : Grid file name.
                           If the grid file name is blank or NULL then nothing

Message_Flag             : Output message flag.
                           If Message_Flag =  0 then no information messages
                           are written.
                           If Message_Flag >= 1 then information messages are
                           written to standard output.

                           tetrahedral elements.

                           If < 0 then the absolute value is assumed to be the
                           number of quad faces and the ID values from the
                           Surf_ID_Flag array will be internally reordered
                           consequtively 1,2,3... in the output grid file.

Number_of_Surf_Trias     : Number of boundary surface tria faces.
                           If < 0 then the absolute value is assumed to be the
                           number of tria faces and the ID values from the
                           Surf_ID_Flag array will be internally reordered
                           consequtively 1,2,3... in the output grid file.

Number_of_Vol_Hexs       : Number of volume grid hex elements.

                           (pyramid).

                           (prismatic).

Number_of_Vol_Tets       : Number of volume grid tet elements.

Surf_Grid_BC_Flag        : Surface face grid boundary condition flag.
                           If Surf_Grid_BC_Flag = NULL then this array is not
                           used and dummy values are written where required.

Surf_ID_Flag             : Surface face ID flag.
                           If Number_of_Surf_Quads or Number_of_Surf_Trias < 0
                           then the ID values from the Surf_ID_Flag array will
                           be internally reordered consequtively 1,2,3... in
                           the output grid file.

Surf_Reconnection_Flag   : Surface face reconnection flag.
                           If Surf_Reconnection_Flag = NULL then this array is
                           not used and dummy values are written where required.

Surf_Quad_Connectivity   : Surface grid quad face connectivity.

Surf_Tria_Connectivity   : Surface grid tria face connectivity.

Vol_Hex_Connectivity     : Volume grid hexahedral element connectivity.

Vol_ID_Flag              : Volume element ID flag.
                           If Vol_ID_Flag = NULL then this array is not used
                           and dummy values are written where required.
			   If all elements of Vol_ID_Flag are set to to the same
                           value and that value is <= 0 then the values of
                           Vol_ID_Flag are determined and set, prior to writing
                           the grid file, from the input surface and volume grid
                           connectivity.

                           type grids.
                           If Initial_Normal_Spacing = NULL then this array is
                           not used and dummy values are written where
                           required.

BL_Thickness             : Thickness of boundary-layer region for boundary-layer
                           type grids.
                           If BL_Thickness = NULL then this array is
                           not used and dummy values are written where
                           required.

RETURN VALUE
------------

0                        : No errors occurred writing grid file.
<0                       : The grid file name is blank, NULL, or is not a
                           standard UG grid file. Nothing is done in this case.
                           The return value will be between -600 and -699.
>0                       : Errors occurred writing grid file.
                           The return value will be between 600 and 699.

Vol_ID_Flag              : Volume element ID flag.
                           If all elements of Vol_ID_Flag are set to -123456
                           on input then the values of Vol_ID_Flag are
                           determined and set from the input surface and volume
                           grid connectivity.
