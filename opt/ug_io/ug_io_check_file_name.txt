DESCRIPTION
-----------

Check a file name and extract case name.

INPUT ARGUMENTS
---------------

File_Name                : Input file name.
                           The input file name must be either a blank, a case
                           name, or a full file name.
                           If the input file name is a blank then the output
                           file name must be a full file name. In this case the
                           case name from the output file name is used to search
                           for a matching input file.
                           If the input file name is a case name then a matching
                           input file will be searched for.
                           If the input file name is a full name it is checked
                           for validity.

Check_File_Flag          : Check option flag.

                           If Check_File_Flag = 1 or 3 then check to see if the
                           file name string contains a full file name or file
                           name suffix. If it is a suffix then use the input
                           argument case name as the case name. The following
                           two possible cases are allowed.
                          
                           1) If the file name string is a full file name of the
                              correct data type then the returned case name
                              string will be derived from the full file name and
                              the returned file name string will be unchanged.

                           2) If the file name string is a suffix of the correct
                              data type (full file name minus case name) and the
                              case name string is not blank then the returned
                              case name string will be unchanged and the
                              returned file name string will be unchanged with
                              Check_File_Flag = 1 or derived from the input case
                              and file name strings with Check_File_Flag = 3.

                           If Check_File_Flag = 2 then search for a matching
                           file name to either the case name string or file name
                           string. The following three possible cases are
                           allowed.
                          
                           1) If the file name string is empty then search for
                              an existing file with a matching case name string.
                              The returned case name string will be unchanged
                              and the returned file name string will be the
                              matching file name.

                           2) If the file name string is a case name (with no
                              suffix) then search for an existing file with a
                              matching case name string. The returned file name
                              string will be the matching file name and the
                              returned case name string will be derived from the
                              returned file name.

                           3) If the file name string is a full file name of the
                              correct type then search for an existing file
                              (with or without compression) which matches that
                              string. The returned file name string will be the
                              matching file name (unchanged unless only a
                              compressed version of the file matches) and the
                              returned case name string will be derived from the
                              returned file name.

File_Data_Type_1         : Primary file type.

                           The file type is used to search for matching files
                           and to check validity of a file name. The numeric
                           values associated with each file data type are
                           defined in the include file, "UG_IO_File_Def.h". A
                           secondary file type is also used after the primary
                           type has been used for searching or checking. The
                           secondary file type is set as follows.

                           Primary File Type           Secondary File Type
                           (File_Data_Type_1)          (File_Data_Type_2)

Output_File_Check        : Input/Output file check option flag.
                           If Output_File_Check = 0 then do not check if the
                           file type derived from the returned file name string
                           is valid for an input or output file.
                           If Output_File_Check = -1 then check if the file type
                           derived from the returned file name string is valid
                           for an input file.
                           If Output_File_Check = 1 then check if the file type
                           derived from the returned file name string is valid
                           for an output file.

RETURN VALUE
------------

0                        : No errors occurred determining file information.
>0                       : The file name is blank or NULL or errors occurred
                           determining file information. The return value will
                           be between 600 and 699.

OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
----------------

File_Name                : File name.

Case_Name                : File case name.

Error_Message            : Error message if the return value is not equal to 0.
