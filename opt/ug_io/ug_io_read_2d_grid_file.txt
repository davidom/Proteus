DESCRIPTION
-----------

Read 2D grid data from a standard UG 2D grid file.

This routine is designed to be called twice for each grid file. The first call
reads the grid file dimensions and the second reads all the grid file data
arrays. Before the second call the grid data arrays must be allocated to
provide at least as much space as required by the grid file dimensions.

INPUT ARGUMENTS (FIRST CALL)
----------------------------

Grid_File_Name           : Grid file name.
                           If the grid file name is blank or NULL then nothing
                           is done.

Message_Flag             : Output message flag.
                           If Message_Flag =  0 then no information messages
                           are written.
                           If Message_Flag >= 1 then information messages are
                           written to standard output.

                           from zero to three corresponding to the four nodes
                           of a particular quad face. The node index value
                           stored in this array can vary from one to
