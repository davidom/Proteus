Proteus
=======

Unstructured Grid/Mesh Library Supporting Efficient Representation, Topological Queries, and Topological Tranformations/Changes.

This greek god, son of Poseidon, lends his name to the etymology of the word "proteus" which is defined as "...tending or able to change frequently or easily.", or "...able to do many different things; versatile, mutable." Homer described Proteus as the "old man of the sea" in reference to his powers as an oracle. If one was able to catch Proteus and hold him, he would be obliged to answer a question (give up a secret). However, this was made difficult by the shape-shifting abilities possesed by Proteus which allowed him, at will, to assume any possible shape. 

This library, like its namesake, comes with the ability to represent almost any shape with arbitrary polygonal (a son of Proteus was Polygonos) and polyhedral discrete geometry; and change shape at will--with many topological changes supported.
